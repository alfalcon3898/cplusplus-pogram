Summary of The Gaming Room Client and Software Requirements 

The Gaming Room was the client, and they requested the design of a cross-platform software application to replicate their existing web-based game, “Draw It or Lose It.” The goal was to create a more scalable and efficient version of the game that could run on multiple platforms, including mobile devices, while ensuring a consistent user experience. 

 What Went Well in Developing the Documentation: 

I did good in clearly defining the software requirements and outlining a detailed project scope that aligned with the client’s needs. My ability to break down complex technical requirements into understandable components helped ensure that all stakeholders were on the same page. 

  

Helpful Aspects of the Design Document Process 

Working through the design document was instrumental in organizing my thoughts and clarifying the software's architecture before diving into coding. It provided a solid foundation for the development process, helping to identify potential challenges early and plan for them accordingly. 

  

Area for Revision 

If I were to revise one part of the documentation, I would focus on the user interface design section. I would improve it by incorporating more user feedback during the initial design phase, ensuring that the interface is intuitive and aligns closely with user expectations. 

  

interpreting and Implementing User Needs: 

I interpreted the user’s needs by closely analyzing their preferences, requirements and how the game is played, which guided the design decisions to enhance the user experience. Considering the user’s needs is crucial in software design because it ensures that the final product is not only functional but also enjoyable and accessible to the target audience. 

  

Approach to Software Design: 

My approach to designing software involved a thorough analysis of user requirements, followed by iterative development and constant communication with stakeholders. So in the future, I would continue using user-centered design techniques and incorporate more iterative feedback loops to refine the product as it evolves
